## Task 1 – Cross-Device Elements Test

The “AppliFashion” app is responsive, so when testing on various viewports, the elements of your application change. Some are hidden, some are made visible, some are repositioned to accommodate the space available. For example, in our app, the Search field is displayed on laptops and tablets but is hidden on mobile devices. Your job is to visually find such changing elements (not all elements) and ensure they are properly hidden or displayed in different viewports and on different browsers.

Tip: After you open the app, simply resize the browser’s width to see “cross-device” elements. Assume V1 is “bug-free” and V2 is buggy.

## Task 2 – Shopping Experience Test

Filter for “Black” shoes. Ensure that there are 2 black shoes and everything works and looks good.

## Task 3 – Product Details Test

Click on the first Black shoe to navigate to its details page. Check if everything looks good and accurate.
